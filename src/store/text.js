Most humans in Egea believe in The Twelve, a pantheon of twelve gods and goddesses who are divided into those that represent the elements that make up the world (the Old Gods) and their children, those that represent the human condition (the Sentinels).<br /><br />While humans have no inherent magical ability, the first human settlers from the north learned from the elves how to control magic with chants, which were written in spellbooks. However, those same settlers then used this newfound power to turn on the elves, driving them to the southern forests where they now reside; this incident is the basis for the hostility between humans and elves in Egea. In the year 952, magic was outlawed and all libraries of spellbooks burned in the human kingdoms after an order of mages attempted to overthrow the king of Normund, but Osirus the Great legalized it again when he became emperor in 1274.<br /><br />+2 Resolve, -1 Wisdom"

They are known for their wisdom and ethereal beauty, and remain isolated from the rest of the world. Like demons, they believe that the God of Chaos and Goddess of Order created Egea, but they only worship the Goddess of Order as their “Gentle Mother” and guide to eternal peace.<br /><br />One of the elves’ defining characteristics is that some are born with the ability to channel energy through their bodies, which is known as magic. While this process can be deadly if too much energy is channeled, magic is considered to be a gift among the elven peoples and those born with it are respected and revered.<br /><br />+1 Wisdom, +1 Finesse, +3 Alignment, -1 Charisma"

They were once a subrace of elves who broke off and retreated to the mountains to the west due to religious differences, namely that they worshipped the God of Chaos and the value of living life in the present, as opposed to following the Goddess of Order and supposed promises of “eternal peace” in heaven.<br /><br />What separates “demons” from modern elves is not only their beast-like characteristics – which have evolved from centuries of interbreeding with the native anthropomorphs for survival – but also their inability to use magic in any form. They seem to have an innate resistance to it, which is just as well since the curse of magic is feared due to its association with their long-time enemies, the elves.<br /><br />+1 Might, +1 Resolve, -3 Alignment, -1 Wisdom"

The one thing they can all agree on is that “surfacers” are idiots, and it’s best to stay out of their politics and conflicts as much as possible.<br /><br />+2 Might, -1 Vitality"

    angel: {
      title: "Angel",
      description: "The winged beings known as “angels” are artificially created using ancient and powerful magic to put the soul of a deceased into a living body, generally an animal. While most angels take the form of winged beasts with above-average intelligence, those that are created from a strong soul and/or host may take on humanoid forms vaguely resembling their former selves.<br /><br />The secret to creating angels was kept by the Holy Mother of Nalan for generations and was used exclusively (and sparingly) by Her Holiness until 1284, when Osirus of Mendebal discovered an old grimoire and used the process to create an heir, the angel Zuleika. Since then, others – namely nobles, since only the rich can afford to hire the sorcerers and purchase the materials needed – have followed suit, and owning an angel has become a sort of status symbol among the upper class of Tyraca, despite the Temple of Twelve frowning on the practice. Elves and demons dislike angels, as well, though for different reasons: the elves are horrified that such a sacred (and feared), ancient ritual has been appropriated and corrupted by humans, and the demons despise all things magic-related, especially things created through magic.<br /><br />+1 Vitality, +1 Wisdom, -1 Might"

Equipped with fins, gills, and sometimes even scales, sirens are well-suited to life underwater, but arms and legs (with webbed fingers and toes) allow them to come ashore as they please to hunt, trade, or socialize.<br /><br />According to the stories told in taverns, sirens lure sailors to their deaths with hauntingly beautiful voices, and then feed on the flesh of their victims. The elves, however, know to fear them because of their powerful water and wind magic, which allow them to stir up devastating storms when threatened.<br /><br />+1 Wisdom, +1 Might, -1 Resolve"

      description: "Ironically, the djinn – a species of illusion-based fae who originate from the Atashino Desert – are the actual demons for which their chaos-worshipping neighbors were nicknamed by the elves. Djinn live for thousands of years and can heal from any wound (except decapitation), and thus are mistakenly believed to be immortal by the other races. While they technically possess corporeal forms, their powerful magic allows them to turn invisible, phase through objects, and even teleport through time and space, and it is said that even once they die, their spirit lingers as a physical manifestation which can continue to affect the world around them.<br /><br />Djinn are rare, but highly sought after for their power, namely the “power to change fate.” According to rumors, a djinni will grant a person’s deepest wish as long as a price, or sacrifice, of equal value is paid.<br /><br />+1 Vitality, +1 Wisdom, -1 Might"

Each tribe had its own unique history, language, and customs, but disease, famine, and conflict following the arrival of large numbers of humanoids in Egea wiped out many anthropomorph tribes. Those that remained either fled to the uninhabitable extremes, such as Atashino Desert, or learned to co-exist in small numbers with elves (and later humans).<br /><br />“Anthropomorph” is a generalized term for a very diverse group of races which developed from a wide variety of animals. Some of the most common are reptiles (Aguama), hares (Koufa), and canines (Lupios), though there are also big cats, birds, bears, horses, goats, oxen, and more. Animal-shifting fae are sometimes confused with anthropomorphs, but they are completely different species – though it is not unheard of for an anthropomorph tribe to adopt an orphan animal-shifter of the same type or vice versa."
